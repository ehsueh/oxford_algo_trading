## Module 2 - Systematic Trading and the State of the Investment Industry

### Introduction to Hedge Funds

- Some different types of funds:
  - Investment trusts
  - Unit trusts
  - Hedge funds (systematic trading is often used here)
- **Systematic trading**
  - Rules are backtested on historical data.
  - Develop a set of rules and not change the method for each trade without altering the rules. As opposed to **discretionary trading** where decisions can be altered on a trade-by-trade basis.
  - Takes intuition and emotion out of trading (hence require more discipline).
  - While the Turtle system was successful, many early systems were not because:
    - They relied on human implementation which can alter from predefined rules due to human emitions.
    - Lack of backtesting and optimization through statistical testing.
  - Also known as a **trading system**.
  - Institutional investors often, through algo trading, break down large transactions into smaller trades to avoid impacting the price. 
  - **A hedge fund** is a loosely regulated investment company that charges incentive and management fee and aims to generate absolute returns by hedging and countering the risk of negative price movements.
  - All hedge funds trading futures need to be registered as **Commodity pool operators (CPOs)**.
  - **Commodity trade advisors (CTAs)** are individuals or organizations that trade or give advice on futures, options or swaps.
  - Characteristics of hedge funds:
    - Structured as limited partnership or limited-liability corp
    - Use lots of leverage
    - Registered offshore
    - Charge incentive (performance) fees
    - Considered as alternative investments because their returns are uncorrelated to stocks or bonds
    - Allow to short
    - Usually have lock-up periods
    - Don't need to publish their holdings so can be less transparent
    - Available only to qualified investors who meet certain criteria
  - Differences between **mutual funds (MFs)** and hedge funds:
    - MF usually doesn't charge investors incentive fees
    - MF doesn't usually leverage
    - MF are transparent and publish their holdings
    - MF keeps a liquidity and allow redemption at any time
  - Comparing **private equity funds (PEFs)** and hedge funds:
    - Similar stucture with hedge funds
    - Unlike hedge funds, PEFs only charge incentive fees when funds are liquidated
    - Both use leverage
    - Unlike hedge funds, they are correlated to the stock market
    - Offer less liquidity than hedge funds
  - First hedge fund was created by investor and sociologist Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949. 
  - Hedge funds need to make sure their strategy are repeateable and scalable so they can retain clients.
  - Four types of hedge fund strategies:
    - **Equity hedge**
      - Get benefit from equity, futures or options trading while minimizing losses due to market falls.
      - Isolate risk of a specific stock from the overall risk of the industry or market it is in.
      - Can utilized pair trading to get long-short term returns uncorrelated to the market.
    - **Event-driven**
      - Managers take advantage of significant potential corporate events that can affect prices. 
      - Example of events:
        - Merger
        - Restructuring, reorganization
        - Liquidation
        - Bankruptcy
    - **Relative value**
      - Take advantage of the predicted valuation discrepancy between different assets. 
      - Bet on creation of discrepancies related to the transaction, instead of the outcome of the transaction itself (such as in event-drive hedge fund strategies).
    - **Macro**
      - Instead of studying the creation of discrepancies, macro strategies study the predicted movements of assets.
      - Studies how macroeconomics metrics affect prices.
    - Two types of hedge funds investors: individual and institutional.

### The Risk of Systematic Funds

    - The **investment risk** of hedge fund is lower than the stock market and also marginally lower than the bond market.
    - A hedge fund is exposed to numerous different **market risks** - the risk to lose value due to unfavourable market movements:
      - Interest rate risk
      - Currency risk
      - Equity market risk
      - Option risk
      - Commodity market risk
      - Credit risk
      - Algorithmic risk
    - Like many finanical institutions, hedge funds use **value-at-risk (VaR)** to manage risk.
    - Two primary features of VaR:
      - Quantifies downsides risk by studying the quantile belonging to the left tail of the profit-losses distribution.
      - Uses current investment position instead of historical position to create a forward-looking measure.
    - Systematic manager should be able to articulate where their edge and return are coming from in terms that can be understood by investors.
